## Conclusion and Recommendation

The data analysis highlights key trends, with April recording the highest sales and March the lowest. "Data Analysis Made Easy" was the top-selling product, and USD-based sales generated the most revenue. However, ZAR contributed the least. To optimize future performance, it's recommended to focus marketing efforts on boosting sales during slower months, particularly targeting regions with lower currency contributions like ZAR, and to leverage the strong performance of USD and top-selling products for targeted campaigns.
